 <h1> How do I know if a item is in stock? </h1>

  <p> An item is in stock if you are able to place that particular item in your shopping bag. If the selected size is greyed out, the item is no longer in stock in that particular size, and you will be unable to place the item in your shopping bag.

  Unfortunately there are times when we are out of stock in an item even though your order went through. This happens mostly during sale season when our sale volumes are higher than normal. We cannot know if your items are in stock until your order is processed. At that time you will receive an email letting you know what is in stock and is on its way.                        </p>
